ABSTRACT
The Robot, named as Wall Climbing Robot is designed to walk on the horizontal surface and to climb vertically.
The robotic structure is inspired by the spider anatomy. The purpose of the robot is to climb vertical surfaces 
where it is difficult for humans to reach also the miniature version of this robot can be used for security purpose.  
Considering these facts, this project is centric about the design and development of the wall climbing robot. 
 The proposed design is battery operated based on  Arduino mega interfaced with servo and suction motors.
 The combination of  suction motors and suction cups are used  to stick the robot to the surface.
 Whereas,all the movement are controlled by servo motors. The instruction for the servo and suction motors are received from controller
 which controls the step by step movements of the robot. The instruction are given in such a way that initially suction motors sticks to 
 the surfaces followed by simultaneous movements of all 8 servo motors. 
 In the next step the suction will be released for one of arm flowered by movement of servo motor of the same arm,
 during this process the load of the robot is being shared by the remaining 3 arms. 
 This process will be repeated for all the 4 arms so as to move the robot in forward direction. 
 This steps will be in the loop until the desired trajectory is completed.
